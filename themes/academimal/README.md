# Academimal

Academimal is a two-column [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme for researchers.
It is based on the awesome [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme
[Minimal](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/) created by
[orderdlist](https://github.com/orderedlist).

## Features

- Bio
- Teaching
- Email
- PGP pubkey
- External links

Note that this theme is a WIP. I plan to add the following features as the
need comes:

- Publication
- Projects
- i18n

## Demo / Example

I use this theme for my own [homepage](http://leiy.me). The source code can
be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/yangl1996/homepage).
