      In this paper we explain how the Data Basis platform helps decisively solve the data access problem for different types of users. We describe its core products: a powerful search engine, a freely accessible data lake featuring a unified schema and hundreds of interoperable tables, and APIs in various programming languages. We exemplify the platform’s utility with discussions of three datasets on labor markets, elections, and local public finances in Brazil. The project is extraordinarily cost-effective: dividing a measure of yearly benefits generated by a conservative estimate of yearly costs to run the organization yields a lower bound social return of 74. We conclude by laying out a roadmap to guide the organization's future steps.

      We study the role of administrative redistricting in promoting local economic development. Exploiting the largest redistricting episode in Brazil, we leverage a unique policy change curbing the creation of new municipalities. Using a rich panel of administrative and spatial data, we implement a difference-in-differences approach comparing municipalities whose requests to split were approved to those with unapproved requests. We find that splitting leads to an expansion of the public sector and improvements in public service delivery in new municipalities without generating significant spillover effects on the formal local economy. The results are consistent with two main mechanisms: reduced remoteness to the new headquarters and increased political accountability. Our findings illustrate that decentralization in form of administrative redistricting can improve public service delivery in disadvantaged and remote areas.

      This paper documents that a large number of African American men experienced a change in racial identity to white during 1880 to 1940, while analogous changes were negligible for other races. We provide descriptive evidence that is consistent with the conventional wisdom that “passing” for white was a response to severe discrimination, and came at great personal cost. The findings suggest that contrary to traditional economic thinking, racial identity is neither entirely exogenous nor fixed over the lifetime, and responds to incentives.

      What is the impact of mobile broadband internet on children's test scores? We compare standardized test scores before and after the staggered entry of 3G into Brazil's 5,570 municipalities using a heterogeneity-robust event-study design. We find no effects of mobile internet on test scores for 5th or 9th grade students, and can reject effect sizes of 0.04 standard deviations in both math and Portuguese. Taken together, our results indicate that the arrival of high-speed mobile internet is not suf- ficient to improve educational outcomes either through direct take-up by individuals or through broader changes to the economy.

      Benefit analyses of mortality reduction policies typically use multiples of the value of a statistical life (VSL). This approach approximates risk premia for small changes in mortality, but inaccurately characterizes premia for large risk changes because it implies increasing marginal utility and a risk-loving attitude. We propose a method to calculate the benefits of large mortality reductions adjusting for risk aversion. We apply this method to calculate the benefits of social distancing and other mitigation strategies to combat COVID-19 in the US and 42 other countries. Our findings show that the typical approach underestimates the benefits of social distancing in the US by a factor of 4.1 and in other countries by a factor of 2.2 on average.
