      Reliable data on corruption are notoriously difficult to obtain. In this paper, we extend and reanalyze corruption data from Brazilian municipalities. We extend the data by  employing a Large Language Model (LLM) to systematically classify 2,197 corruption audit reports. We first show that correlations between the LLM-generated corruption measures and manually coded assessments are comparable to correlations among the manual datasets themselves, highlighting both the relative reliability of the LLM classification and the inherent subjectivity involved in quantifying corruption from textual sources. Using this expanded corruption dataset, we revisit key findings in the literature about the impact of reelection incentives on corruption. Our results support previous findings in the literature that reelection incentives reduce corruption, although the result is only statistically significant for one out of three measures of corruption. Furthermore, we document significant heterogeneity in the effect over time and investigate several explanations for these empirical patterns, including changing composition of politicians and increasing probability of legal penalties.

      Policies often entail costs today but benefits far into the future, as in the case of climate change mitigation. A key factor shaping how this intertemporal trade-off is addressed is the age of the politicians in power. We study closely contested elections in Brazil and show that when a young politician is in power there is less deforestation and lower greenhouse gas emissions, with no apparent trade-off in terms of local income. Results are partly explained by young mayors turning over the bureaucracy with younger public servants.

      This paper documents several new facts about racial discrimination from 1910-1940 in the United States. Exposure to racial discrimination was positively associated with some Black men taking on White identities, resulting in large income gains and economic mobility. However, this imposed high social costs; beyond the loss of one’s Black identity, passing for White was associated with higher separation rates from a person’s community and family. Using the income gains from passing, we estimate that removing contemporaneous labor market discrimination would have increased the Black-to-White income ratio by at least 16 percentage points.

      We provide evidence of a new channel through which politicians can exchange favors with campaign donors: earlier payment in procurement contracts. We exploit an electoral reform in Brazil that bans corporate contributions and partially breaks down the relationship between donors and politicians. Using a within-firm difference-in-differences identification strategy, we find that connected firms experience longer payment terms post-reform. The effect is larger in municipalities with low liquidity, where payment delays are more common, and for contracts awarded through a competitive tendering process. Our results point to the importance of designing rules that curb discretion over payment dates in government purchases.

      Changes in political boundaries aimed at devolving power to local governments are common in many countries. We examine the economic consequences of redistricting through the creation of smaller government units. Exploiting reforms that led to sharp variations in the number of government units in Brazil, we show that voluntary redistricting increases the size of the public sector, public services delivery, and economic activity in new local governments over the long-term. These benefits are not offset by losses elsewhere and are stronger in peripheral and remote backward areas that are neglected by their parent governments. We provide evidence that the decentralization of decision-making power boosts local development in disadvantaged areas beyond simply gains in fiscal revenues.

      We document how electoral behavior changes based on the salience of national security threats. In the context of Israel and with novel data on the timing and location of ``Red Alerts'' - siren warnings of rocket threats - we estimate a difference-in-differences with voting patterns in areas newly exposed to Hamas' rocket range in 2014. Our analysis shows that Red Alerts on the days immediately before the election boosted Likud’s vote share by 2.9 percentage points, while earlier alerts had no effect. Polarization increases as the effects are larger where Likud support was already higher.

      We study how environmental sanctions and spillovers improve forest conservation in the Brazilian Amazon. Using a difference-in-differences framework and novel farm-level data, we show that sanctions curbed deforestation and promoted reforestation among punished farmers and their neighbors. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that even sanctions with limited incapacitation potential elicited relevant behavioral changes. In particular, farmers’ responsiveness to sanctions coincided with the government’s commitment to enforcement. We do not find substantial evidence of spatial displacement or monitoring evasion. Overall, sanctions prevented 1.6 billion tons of CO2 emissions between 2006 and 2019, equivalent to 31% of US emissions in 2021.

      What is the impact of mobile broadband internet on children's test scores? We compare standardized test scores before and after the staggered entry of 3G into Brazil's 5,570 municipalities using a heterogeneity-robust event-study design. We find no effects of mobile internet on test scores for 5th or 9th grade students, and can reject effect sizes of 0.04 standard deviations in both math and Portuguese. Taken together, our results indicate that the arrival of high-speed mobile internet is not suf- ficient to improve educational outcomes either through direct take-up by individuals or through broader changes to the economy.
