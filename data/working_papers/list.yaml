      We study how administrative redistricting promotes local development. Exploiting a large episode of voluntary municipality splits in Brazil and a rich panel of administrative and spatial data, we compare paths of development between areas that split and those that did not. We find that splitting had broadly positive effects, with any potential loss of scale from smaller governments being at least partially compensated by extra federal transfers new municipalities received. We find that splitting led to an expansion of the public sector, improvements in public service delivery, and increases in economic activity in new municipalities. We show that autonomy and reductions to administrative distance help explain results beyond simply gains in revenue. Our findings illustrate that decentralization in form of subsidized voluntary administrative redistricting can improve public service delivery in disadvantaged areas.

      A fundamental difficulty in policy-making is that policies often have costs today but benefits far into the future. This difficulty is particularly salient to climate change and environmental conservation policies. A critical dimension in this trade-off is the age of politicians. Younger politicians have a longer lifespan, which could lead them to weigh more future policy benefits. However, younger politicians might be more prone to show short-term economic results to climb the political ladder. We study this trade-off in the case of Brazilian mayors and deforestation, using a regression discontinuity design for close elections. We find that when a young politician is elected, there is a reduction in deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions intensity, without significant effects on municipal gross domestic product. The results also show that younger politicians allocate more budget to education and capital investment, suggesting that the time horizon aspect dominates the trade-off. These results illustrate the importance of youth political participation for long-term policy.

      In this paper we explain how the Data Basis platform helps decisively solve the data access problem for different types of users. We describe its core products: a powerful search engine, a freely accessible data lake featuring a unified schema and hundreds of interoperable tables, and APIs in various programming languages. We exemplify the platform’s utility with discussions of three datasets on labor markets, elections, and local public finances in Brazil. The project is extraordinarily cost-effective: dividing a measure of yearly benefits generated by a conservative estimate of yearly costs to run the organization yields a lower bound social return of 74. We conclude by laying out a roadmap to guide the organization's future steps.

      This paper documents that a large number of African American men experienced a change in racial identity to white during 1880 to 1940, while analogous changes were negligible for other races. We provide descriptive evidence that is consistent with the conventional wisdom that “passing” for white was a response to severe discrimination, and came at great personal cost. The findings suggest that contrary to traditional economic thinking, racial identity is neither entirely exogenous nor fixed over the lifetime, and responds to incentives.

      What is the impact of mobile broadband internet on children's test scores? We compare standardized test scores before and after the staggered entry of 3G into Brazil's 5,570 municipalities using a heterogeneity-robust event-study design. We find no effects of mobile internet on test scores for 5th or 9th grade students, and can reject effect sizes of 0.04 standard deviations in both math and Portuguese. Taken together, our results indicate that the arrival of high-speed mobile internet is not suf- ficient to improve educational outcomes either through direct take-up by individuals or through broader changes to the economy.

#      Benefit analyses of mortality reduction policies typically use multiples of the value of a statistical life (VSL). This approach approximates risk premia for small changes in mortality, but inaccurately characterizes premia for large risk changes because it implies increasing marginal utility and a risk-loving attitude. We propose a method to calculate the benefits of large mortality reductions adjusting for risk aversion. We apply this method to calculate the benefits of social distancing and other mitigation strategies to combat COVID-19 in the US and 42 other countries. Our findings show that the typical approach underestimates the benefits of social distancing in the US by a factor of 4.1 and in other countries by a factor of 2.2 on average.
