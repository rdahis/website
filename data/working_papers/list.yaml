      We extend Brazilian municipal corruption data using a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze 2,197 audit reports, totaling 185,000 pages. LLM-generated measures correlate nearly as strongly with manual classifications as different manual classifications correlate with each other, highlighting both the relative reliability of the LLM classification and the inherent subjectivity involved in quantifying corruption from textual sources. Reexamining reelection incentives' role in limiting corruption, we find effects that are consistent with prior studies, but smaller and more precisely estimated, with statistical significance for only one of three corruption measures. We document substantial temporal heterogeneity in effects across electoral terms, with reelection incentives reducing corruption from 2003 to 2004, the period analyzed by the previous literature, and from 2013 to 2015, but not from 2005 to 2012. We explore potential explanations for this pattern, including politician composition changes and evolving legal enforcement patterns.

      While deforestation may yield short-term economic gains, it has lasting impacts on climate change, biodiversity, and water systems. The age of political leaders is a key determinant of how these tradeoffs are managed. We study closely contested elections in Brazil and show that when a young politician is in power there is less deforestation (p-value 0.000), lower greenhouse gas emissions (p-value 0.061), but higher local income (p-value 0.023). Results are partly explained by young mayors turning over the bureaucracy with younger public servants (p-value 0.043).

      This paper introduces a new disaggregated and harmonized dataset on public procurement and budget execution by Brazilian subnational entities, which covers half of Brazilian municipalities and spans the years 2003-21. This dataset provides key information that was previously unavailable from aggregate data, such as the identities of suppliers, details on purchases of goods and services, and granular information on the life cycle of each expenditure action. It then uses these data to provide new stylized facts about local public finance. First, it shows that about one-quarter of government purchases are locally procured and discusses implications for efficiency. Second, it demonstrates that close to 15 percent of payments exceed the 30-day threshold and that payment timeliness is systematically correlated with the income level of the municipality. Finally, it shows that municipalities where mayors have reelection incentives systematically employ more non-competitive tenders and buy more from local suppliers.

      This study documents how electoral behavior changes based on the salience of national security threats. Leveraging novel data on siren timing and location in Israel, we estimate a difference-in-differences design that compares localities brought into rocket range just before the 2015 election with otherwise similar areas. While almost all rockets from that period were intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system, the analysis shows that Red Alerts on the days immediately before the election boosted Likud’s vote share by 2.6 percentage points, while earlier alerts had no effect. Polarization increases as the effects are larger where Likud support was already higher. Analysis of Google search data shows that alerts increased interest in security-related topics but not in politics or parties, consistent with a salience rather than ideological mechanism.

      This paper documents several new facts about racial discrimination from 1910-1940 in the United States. Exposure to racial discrimination was positively associated with some Black men taking on White identities, resulting in large income gains and economic mobility. However, this imposed high social costs; beyond the loss of one’s Black identity, passing for White was associated with higher separation rates from a person’s community and family. Using the income gains from passing, we estimate that removing contemporaneous labor market discrimination would have increased the Black-to-White income ratio by at least 16 percentage points.

      We provide evidence of a new channel through which politicians can exchange favors with campaign donors: earlier payment in procurement contracts. We exploit an electoral reform in Brazil that bans corporate contributions and partially breaks down the relationship between donors and politicians. Using a within-firm difference-in-differences identification strategy, we find that connected firms experience longer payment terms post-reform. The effect is larger in municipalities with low liquidity, where payment delays are more common, and for contracts awarded through a competitive tendering process. Our results point to the importance of designing rules that curb discretion over payment dates in government purchases.

      We study how environmental sanctions and spillovers improve forest conservation in the Brazilian Amazon. Using a difference-in-differences framework and novel farm-level data, we show that sanctions curbed deforestation and promoted reforestation among punished farmers and their neighbors. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that even sanctions with limited incapacitation potential elicited relevant behavioral changes. In particular, farmers’ responsiveness to sanctions coincided with the government’s commitment to enforcement. We do not find substantial evidence of spatial displacement or monitoring evasion. Overall, sanctions prevented 1.6 billion tons of CO2 emissions between 2006 and 2019, equivalent to 31% of US emissions in 2021.

      What is the impact of mobile broadband internet on children's test scores? We compare standardized test scores before and after the staggered entry of 3G into Brazil's 5,570 municipalities using a heterogeneity-robust event-study design. We find no effects of mobile internet on test scores for 5th or 9th grade students, and can reject effect sizes of 0.04 standard deviations in both math and Portuguese. Taken together, our results indicate that the arrival of high-speed mobile internet is not suf- ficient to improve educational outcomes either through direct take-up by individuals or through broader changes to the economy.
