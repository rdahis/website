      While deforestation may yield short-term economic gains, it has lasting impacts on climate change, biodiversity, and water systems. The age of political leaders is a key determinant of how these tradeoffs are managed. We study closely contested elections in Brazil and show that when a young politician is in power there is less deforestation (p-value 0.000), lower greenhouse gas emissions (p-value 0.061), but higher local income (p-value 0.023). Results are partly explained by young mayors turning over the bureaucracy with younger public servants (p-value 0.043).

      This paper introduces a new disaggregated and harmonized dataset on public procurement and budget execution by Brazilian subnational entities, which covers half of Brazilian municipalities and spans the years 2003-21. This dataset provides key information that was previously unavailable from aggregate data, such as the identities of suppliers, details on purchases of goods and services, and granular information on the life cycle of each expenditure action. It then uses these data to provide new stylized facts about local public finance. First, it shows that about one-quarter of government purchases are locally procured and discusses implications for efficiency. Second, it demonstrates that close to 15 percent of payments exceed the 30-day threshold and that payment timeliness is systematically correlated with the income level of the municipality. Finally, it shows that municipalities where mayors have reelection incentives systematically employ more non-competitive tenders and buy more from local suppliers.

      Changes in political boundaries aimed at devolving power to local governments are common in many countries. We examine the economic consequences of redistricting through the creation of smaller government units. Exploiting reforms that led to sharp variations in the number of government units in Brazil, we show that voluntary redistricting increases the size of the public sector, public services delivery, and economic activity in new local governments over the long-term. These benefits are not offset by losses elsewhere and are stronger in peripheral and remote backward areas that are neglected by their parent governments. We provide evidence that the decentralization of decision-making power boosts local development in disadvantaged areas beyond simply gains in fiscal revenues.

      In the absence of strong incentives, public service delivery crucially depends on bureaucrat selection. Despite wide adoption by governments, it is unclear whether civil service examinations reliably select for job performance. We investigate this question focusing on state judges in Brazil. Exploring monthly data on judicial output and cross-court movement, we estimate that judges account for at least 23% of the observed variation in number of cases disposed. With novel data on admission examinations, we show that judges with higher grades perform better than lower-ranked peers. Our results suggest competitive examinations can be an effective way to screen candidates.

      Cost-benefit analyses in public health typically calculate the benefits of mortality reduction interventions by multiplying the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) and the expected decrease in fatalities. This procedure approximates the benefits of small mortality changes but is inaccurate for large risk changes because it holds constant the VSL---an estimate of a marginal rate of substitution. Building on the theoretical framework of the VSL, we outline a practical approach to calculate the benefits of non-marginal mortality reductions with empirically-calibrated compensating variations. We derive closed-form expressions that are easy to calculate and only require widely-available mortality statistics.

      Transportation costs are an under-studied barrier to political participation. In many elections worldwide, subsidies to voter transportation are already provided or are under discussion. However, these types of incentives have not been rigorously evaluated. Here we examine possibly the world’s largest-ever intervention to lower these costs, the adoption of a fare-free public transit policy in Brazil during the 2022 national election, when about half of Brazilian voters were granted the right to use public transit for free on election days. However, while some cities adopted the benefit for both rounds of the election, others adopted it only for the second round. Using an event study design, we exploit this difference in adoption timing to examine the policy’s causal impact on voter turnout rates and human mobility levels. We find that fare-free transit increased ridership between 7.2% and 17.5% on election days, however, we estimate a precise and robust null effect of the policy on voter turnout (Coef.  0.03p.p. with standard error of 0.22p.p.). Our results illustrate that monetary transport costs may not always be a critical factor behind non-participation. Although reducing transportation costs improves access to polling places, we show that even a full transit subsidy may not be sufficient to increase voter turnout.

      Government policies may impact economic outcomes directly but also indirectly through effects on political incentives. This paper examines the effects of the PPCDAm -- a centralized set of environmental policies that effectively raised the expected cost of illegal deforestation -- on the behavior of a powerful special-interest group operating in the Brazilian Amazon: farmers. Using different identification strategies, we document that municipalities governed by farmer politicians experienced larger declines in deforestation, greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, and violence than municipalities governed by other politicians after this set of policies were implemented. Our findings are consistent with the PPCDAm changing political incentives in a persistent way that amplifies its impact on environmental and social outcomes.
