I am currently visiting the [Department of Economics at Brown University](https://economics.brown.edu/) during the 2022 Fall quarter. I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Economics at PUC-Rio](http://www.econ.puc-rio.br/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Development, Politics, and Environmental Economics. I connect theory-driven questions to granular data and natural experiments to learn about the process of development in low- and middle-income countries.

I have co-founded and lead the data team at [Base dos Dados](https://basedosdados.org/), a nonprofit start-up with the mission to make access to high-quality data universal in Brazil. We build tools such as a search engine and a public datalake to facilitate data work for academics, journalists, policy makers, companies, and developers.
