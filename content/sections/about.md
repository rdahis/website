I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Economics at PUC-Rio](http://www.econ.puc-rio.br/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Development, Politics, and Environmental Economics.

I have co-founded and lead the data team at [Data Basis (Base dos Dados)](https://basedosdados.org/), a nonprofit start-up with the mission to make access to high-quality data universal in Brazil. We build tools such as a search engine and a public datalake to facilitate data work for academics, journalists, policy makers, companies, and developers.
